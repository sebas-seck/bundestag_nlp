# Politics & NLP

Political opinions expressed exceed what a human can digest. That makes measuring changes in opinions with NLP a case. Here, I focus on a specific item on the political agenda, the sudden turnaround of energy politics following the external shock of the nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. The overall goal is the development of a methodology to extract opinions from political speech.

In this repo, I pick up efforts undertaken with NLP for my Master's thesis in 2017/18.
